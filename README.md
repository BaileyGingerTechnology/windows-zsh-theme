## Installation

### Manual

Just copy the [`windows.zsh-theme`](/windows.zsh-theme) to your `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/` folder.

This set of commands will probably do what you want:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/juliavallina/windows-zsh-theme.git
ln -s $PWD/windows-zsh-theme/windows.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/windows.zsh-theme
```

Then set `ZSH_THEME="windows"` inside your `.zshrc`.

Here's the [official docs](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Customization#overriding-and-adding-themes) on how to do that.
